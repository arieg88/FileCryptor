# File Encryption Tool

A simple and secure file encryption solution that uses AES encryption to protect your sensitive files. This tool allows you to easily encrypt and decrypt files using a password-based key, ensuring that only authorized users can access the contents. The program hashes the password with SHA-512 and encrypts the file using AES in CBC mode, offering strong protection for your data. It also provides a straightforward command-line interface for both encryption and decryption operations.

## Features

- Encrypt files using AES with a password-based key.
- Decrypt encrypted files with the correct password.
- Uses SHA-512 to hash passwords for added security.
- Command-line interface for easy file encryption and decryption.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Install the required dependencies with `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arieg88/FileCryptor.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd file-encryption-tool
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Encrypt a file

To encrypt a file, run the following command:

```bash
python file_encryption.py lock [filename]
```

You will be prompted to enter a password. The file will be encrypted and saved with a `.encr` extension.\
Pay attention, it will not delete your original file! only make an encrypted one.

### Decrypt a file

To decrypt an encrypted file, run the following command:

```bash
python file_encryption.py unlock [filename]
```

You will be prompted to enter the password. If the correct password is provided, the file will be decrypted.
